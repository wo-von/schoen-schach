# schoen-schach
Reinventing the chessboard.  

## Motivation
This is going to be my first try at 100DaysofCode. Read more about the 100DaysofCode challenge [here](https://www.100daysofcode.com/).  

I used to play chess with computers as I was a kid. Back then, I was not smart enough to get impressed by what was actually impressive (which is computers playing chess), but by how quickly they were able to realize I was mated. I personally needed to check all 8 squares around my king one by one to make sure I was mated or not, every time my king was checked.  

Moreover, I am not coding python as much as I want to. So I am trying to structurally and regularly code something that really impressed me as a kid, in a programming language I want to get better at, and under a challenge which is famous around the internet and I personally find simple and effective. Showing up everyday is the way almost all complex software projects are created (other type of projects probably also).  

And cherry on top: I just found out through a [tweet](https://twitter.com/MagnusCarlsen/status/1417513223914393606)
by Magnus Carlsen, that today is [world chess day](https://www.un.org/en/observances/world-chess-day)!
## Goals
* Write an interactive chess board that automatically records the moves
* Corresponding GUI
* Maybe rewrting it in a way that a chess engine can be mounted on it.
* And probably most importantly: code for 100 days, starting July, 20th 2021.
