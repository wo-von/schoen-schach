# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: before 4th Nov 2021

**Progress:** 
- Set up the repository, added (through github) gitignore, and license, updated readme and started the log
- Added examples from these courses and also CS50's artificial intelligence course.
- decide to use pygame instead of tkinter, but might give that a go some other time too if pygame proves not good enough working with pictures, but should be ok.

[Problem set 3 of the MIT's 6.002 is what is being considered here](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0002-introduction-to-computational-thinking-and-data-science-fall-2016/assignments/Ù°)

**Thoughts:**  
I started this in July and then quit immediately, which is not the point of 100 days of code. That is why I am calling everything before day 0, and 4th Nov. as day 1. I should stick to the challenge from now on.


### Day 1: 4th Nov 2021

**Progress:** 
- Based on the Minsweeper example and a [tutorial online](https://dr0id.bitbucket.io/legacy/pygame_tutorial00.html) made the board. It is now properly resized, has a caption. But nothing else

**Thoughts:** 

**TODO:** 
Find a better PNG image file for the board, since it needs to have boundaries so that I can print the coordinates (A..H and 1..8). it might need to later be refactored into a class so that multiple instances of it can be run, since pygame supports only one screen
