# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 20th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Set up the repository, added (through github) gitignore, and license, updated readme and started the log

**Thoughts:** just having a peaceful first day

### Day 2: July 21st, 2021:

**Today's progress** 

started the objects for peices and board. Reviewd python obbjects from past courses (MITx 6001 and 6002). Added examples from these courses and also CS50's artificial intelligence course.

**Thoughts** 

should be much faster and also not overthink everything so that i can get the initial version quickly. Also, the idea to make it work via ascii art is probably not very smart, since it does not make the GUI later simpler. I guess  i start right away with GUI, there is tkinter and pygame. Should decide which one to use

**TODO** 

ٰDecide on a GUI library, either tkinter or pygame or maybe sth else. Review code of robot visualizer and minesweeper quickly.

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
